This folder contains all the versions of the modified project part 2, which entails the modification of the Bicycle Light (with the MPU 9250) into a Room Thermometer (utilising the same except a MPU 6050)based on certain requested conditions.

Prompt: The client has asked that you design the form, function, and interaction of a new device that uses RGB LEDs as indicators and a motion sensor as input to operate as a novel temperature measuring device. The client is excited about using such a device in a room to know the temperature as well as have an indication of how much hotter or cooler the room is compared with the average temperature across the last 24 hours, week, month, year. The client is also interested to think about visualizing other trends like comparing todayâ€™s temperature at 1:00pm vs what it was yesterday at 1:00pm vs the average temperature at 1:00pm across a week.
